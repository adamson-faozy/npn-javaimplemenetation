# npn-javaimplemenetation
a java script that solves correctly formated npn formulas only
forgive the poor code quality, had not learned how to properly write standard java quality codes then

# EXAMPLE INPUTS IF YOU WANT TO TEST

x + 6 x 2 - x 2 + 4 2 10 + 6 x 2 - x 2 + 4 2 10

''' + 5 6    (the ''' are to stop conversion to bullet point)

6  (technically not a formula but java script handles it)

6 + (prints out invalid)

can randomly change the numbers for more examples
